#  JavaScript to test the API Endpoint


## Description
In this project we used JavaScriptâ€™s fetch() function to make HTTP requests to the API endpoints.
For parsing and validating the response received, .json() method is used. 
The response is saved to a variable and validated against the requirements.
Assert module is used for verifying the conditions. The assert.strictEqual() function tests strict equality between the actual and expected parameters.

## Requirements
Given API End Point = ' https://api.tmsandbox.co.nz/v1/Categories/6327/Details.json?catalogue=false'

This script tests the API endpoint to validate the following acceptance criteria : 
- Name = "Carbon credits"
- CanRelist = true
- The Promotions element with Name = "Gallery" has a Description containing "Good position in category"
Method used : 'GET'
